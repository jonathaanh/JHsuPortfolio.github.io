		<h2>Why it's My Favorite Movie</h2>
		<p>
			Inception is my favorite movie because the story line is so good,and <br>
			the things that are happening kind of mess with your head. The fact that <br>
			people can plant ideas in your head,in dreams within dreams,is kind of <br>
			crazy. The movie is truelly mind boggling and amazingly well directed.
		</p>
		<h2>My Favorite Actor</h2>
		<p>
			My favorite actor is Leonardo DiCaprio because he is such a great actor in <br>
			the movie Inception. He plays as the main character named Cobb and he does <br>
			such a good job acting in the movie.
