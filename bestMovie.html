	<h2 style="font-family:courier;color:powderblue;">Why it's My Favorite Movie</h2>
	<p style="font-family:verdana;">
		Inception is my favorite movie because the story line is so good,and <br>
		the things that are happening kind of mess with your head. The fact that <br>
		people can plant ideas in your head,in dreams within dreams,is kind of <br>
		crazy. The movie is truelly mind boggling and amazingly well directed.

	<h2 style="font-family:courier;color:powderblue;">My Favorite Actor</h2>
	<p style="font-family:verdana;">
	My favorite actor is Leonardo DiCaprio because he is such a great actor in <br>
	the movie Inception. He plays as the main character named Cobb and he does <br>
	such a good job acting in the movie.
