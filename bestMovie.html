	<h2>Why it's My Favorite Movie</h2>
	<p>
		Inception is my favorite movie because the story line is so good,and 
		the things that are happening kind of mess with your head. The fact that
		people can plant ideas in your head,in dreams within dreams,is kind of 
		crazy. The movie is truelly mind boggling and amazingly well directed.

	<h2>My Favorite Actor</h2>
	<p>
	My favorite actor is Leonardo DiCaprio because he is such a great actor in
	the movie Inception. He plays as the main character named Cobb and he does
	such a good job with emotion in the movie.
