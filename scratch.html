		<h1>Name Assignment</h1>
		<p><img src="images/nameproject.jpg"/ width="400" height="300"> </p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Used scratch to design and create a program that shows my name. The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and give them 3 unique behaviors. The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a function to reset the scene to the beginning each time the green flag was clicked.</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Using event blocks - green flag clicked , when key pressed</li>
			<li>Used loops - I used a forever block to move my main sprite back and forth</li>
			<li>Sprites -I used the library of sprites to find letters in my name and I also created my own sprite using the sprite editor.</li>
			<li>Movement - I used the turn motion to turn some of my sprites and the size movement to change the size of the sprite</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>Computer Buying Project</h1>
		<p><img src="images/computerbuyingproject.png"/ width="400" height="300"> </p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Used scratch to create a slideshow that would give people information about computers and then tell them advice on which computer they should choose. The requirements were to give people detailed facts about 4 different computer options and select which one would fit their circumstance the most.</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Backdrops - used backdrops as the information on the slides</li>
			<li>Using event blocks - green flag clicked , when key pressed</li>
			<li>Used loops and if statements to move between the slides</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>Final Project</h1>
		<p><img src="images/final.png"/ width="400" height="300"> </p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>For the final project, we were either able to create a game or a story. I chose a game for my project. The requirements for the game were that it had to have levels, a timer, a score, and a way for the user to win the game. In the end, I created the line game where users navigated through the course using their mouse.</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Backdrops - used as the different levels in the game</li>
			<li>Variables - used as the timer and the level display </li>
			<li>Loops and if statements - used to ask whether or not the user was touching a certain color</li>
			<li>Sensors - used to tell whether the user was touching a color</li>
		</ul>
